# Session Scribe

Turn your D&D session recordings into polished narrative recaps.

## What It Does

Takes your session artifacts and generates a detailed recap:

- **Input**: Microsoft Teams transcript + Roll20 dice log
- **Output**: Scene-by-scene narrative with key events, dialogue, and character moments
- **Export**: DOCX (styled) or Markdown

The AI identifies story beats, extracts details (items, gold, NPCs), and writes it up without mechanical jargon.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest release for your platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)
2. Open Settings and enter your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Add your players (real name → character name)
    - or let the app detect them from your first transcript
4. Optionally add known NPCs
    - the app will also discover new ones during generation

## Typical Workflow

1. **Import** your Teams transcript (.txt file)
2. **Import** your Roll20 dice log (optional but adds context)
3. **Generate** - click the button and wait (longer sessions take a few minutes)
4. **Review & Export** - regenerate if needed, or export to DOCX/Markdown for final edits

## Tips

- Make sure your transcript has clear speaker labels
- The AI detects NPCs automatically - you can save them for future sessions
- Generation uses multiple AI passes, so be patient with long sessions
